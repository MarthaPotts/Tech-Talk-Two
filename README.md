# Tech-Talk-Two

## Description

Tech-Talk-Two is the child of dysfunctional parents TechTalk and TechBlog created while attending the intensive OSU Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp "part-time" (no such thing)
It is intended to be an intuitive Content Management Style blog demonstrating Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure and my level of comprehension of said demon

Sleep-deprived humor aside, Tech-Talk-Two does has an inuitive user interface and blog functionality. It's built on Node.js and Express.js supported in the back by Sequelize, my new best friend

## Installation

Clone/fork the repo, it's open-source. Have Node.js and npm pre-installed on your local machine, and requires access to mysql/SQL database

## Contact

Leave a message for me here on the 'hub and I'll get back with you as soon as possible
